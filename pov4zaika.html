        <h2 class='lightbg'>Converting 2D image into mosaic of 3D objects</h2>
        <p class='lightbg justborder'>POVRay mosaic is a set of programs, which read every pixel of source image and convert it into a virtual 3D object, packed side by side with objects created from other pixels, thus creating something like 3D-mosaic in <a href='https://www.povray.org/'>POVRay</a> format. You can <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/POVmosaic'>download POVRay mosaic from GitHub</a> for free.</p>
        <div class='lightbg justborder cols512'>
            <p><b>4zaika</b> is a small program, opening a PNG image, and converting it into a mosaic of 3D objects, packed in <b>square</b> pack. Each source pixel is turned into a 3D cube, colored like this pixel. Surely, instead of cubes, other 3D shapes may be used; at the moment of writing 4zaika provides seven prebuilt object types, and new ones may be easily inserted.</p>
            <p>Since POV files are text files, containing 3D scene description, they can be easily edited; 4zaika output is as human-friendly as possible, reasonably commented internally, and, besides, there is a help file with more prolific descriptions. Next to the examples below there are short descriptions of changes introduced into scene file before rendering.</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/401.png' width='512'>
                <p class='small center pre'>thingie = thingie_4</p>
            </div>
            <p>The main idea behind 4zaika is <b>mapping</b>. Object properties (size, position, rotation) can be mapped to (that is, made functions of) source image pixel properties, currently brightness. Ok, let's map something:</p>
            <div class='justborder center chess' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/402.png' width='512'>
                <p class='small center pre lightbg'>thingie = thingie_3 scale_all = &lt;1, 1, 5&gt;; scale_map = &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;;</p>
            </div>
            <p>Not too bad for a simple example, may even go for a logo.</p>
            <p>Since version 1.6.21, all predefined maps were replaced by generalized linear spline interpolation. Descriptive part in the beginning of POV file generated look like this:</p>
            <pre>
    #declare Curve = function {
        spline { linear_spline
            0.0,   &lt;0.0,   0&gt;
            0.25,  &lt;0.25,  0&gt;
            0.5,   &lt;0.5,   0&gt;
            0.75,  &lt;0.75,  0&gt;
            1.0,   &lt;1.0,   0&gt;}
        }
    #declare map = function(c) {Curve(c).u}</pre>
            <p>This map is direct analog of Photoshop and GIMP "Curves", so general idea should be familiar: first column contain input values, second column contain corresponding output values (third column currently is not used for anything good, just leave it alone). By default, input=output, that is, map does not change anything. However, you can edit it.</p>
            <p>Note that POVRay does not pay attention to the order of control points appearance, so you can add midpoints after endpoints in no particular order. Just remember to have endpoints 0 and 1 defined, since POVRay cannot use undefined functions; everything between 0 and 1 is up to you to edit.</p>
            <p>Beside scaling, we can also map rotation and position:</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/403.png' width='512'>
                <p class='small center pre lightbg'>thingie_5 move_map = &lt;0, 0, -2&gt;; rotate_map = &lt;60, 60, 180&gt;; and rotate_all = &lt;-10, -20, -20&gt;; for baseline</p>
            </div>
            <p>In general, I'd suggest gradually changing setting one by one, unless you are not afraid of total mess. And you will be. You will be.</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/404.png' width='512'>
                <p class='small center pre lightbg'>thingie_5 evenodd_offset = &lt;0.5, 0, 0&gt; rotate_rnd = &lt;10, 10, 10&gt;;</p>
            </div>
            <p>Just several degrees of randomization may help break monotonous pattern.</p>
            <p>But let's get back to mapping and look at it's capabilities more closely:</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/405.png' width='512'>
                <p class='small center pre lightbg'>thingie_3 thingie_finish_3 scale_all = &lt;0.6, 0.6, 2&gt;; rotate_map = &lt;160, 120, 0&gt;;</p>
            </div>
            <p>Well, not quite a painting, but may be considered art. After all, painter is mapping brushstrokes direction to image sigmal, and we are mapping virtual cylinders rotation, what's the difference?</p>
            <p>Note, in the scene above I edited camera to <span class='pre'>look_at&lt;0.005, 0.025, 0.0&gt;</span> to keep it centered since growing cylinders went off margins.</p>
            <p>Let's make it bolder:</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/406.png' width='512'>
                <p class='small center pre lightbg'>thingie_3 thingie_finish_4 scale_all = &lt;1.5, 1.5, 2.5&gt;; rotate_map = &lt;160, 120, 0&gt;;</p>
            </div>
            <p>Superellipsoids also make nice 3D-brush strokes.</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='4z/408.png' width='512'></div>
            <p>One of the funny things about POVMosaic programs is, beside editing resulting files directly, you can plug a preset file in them, redefining everything. Preset files are regular POVRay .inc files and must be plugged after standard objects to overwrite them.</p>
            <p>Below is result of adding just one string <span class='pre'>#include "preset_02.inc"</span> (preset_02.inc is included into project distribution, so you can investigate how it works):</p>
            <div class='justborder center' style='column-span: all;'><img src='4z/407.png' width='1024'>
                <p class='small center pre lightbg'>#include "preset_02.inc"</p>
            </div>
        </div>
