    <h2 class='lightbg'>Converting 2D image into mosaic of 3D objects</h2>
    <p class='lightbg justborder'>POVRay mosaic is a set of programs, which read every pixel of source image and convert it into a virtual 3D object, packed side by side with objects created from other pixels, thus creating something like 3D-mosaic in <a href='https://www.povray.org/' target='_top'>POVRay</a> format. You can <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/POVmosaic' target='_top'>download POVRay mosaic from GitHub</a> for free.</p>
    <div class='lightbg justborder cols512'>
        <p>This whole story begun decades ago when I needed some way to simulate real world colored sphere packing. There are some ad and deco technologies, based on constructing big pictures from plastic balls, and I needed a quick preview for expected result.</p>
        <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='3z/300.png' width='512'><p class='small center'>default output</p></div>
        <p>Necessary program was created and successfully used. And forgotten, also successfully.</p>
        <p>Until now.</p>
        <p><b>3zaika</b> program is a part of POVMosaic project, intended for opening source PNG image, and creating <b>triangle</b>-packed mosaics of 3D objects in <a href='https://www.povray.org/' target='_top'>POVRay</a> format, colored after source image pixels.</p>
        <p>Most important features of the program are:</p>
        <p><b>Configurable output.</b> Since POV files are text files, containing 3D scene description, they can be easily edited; 3zaika output is as human-friendly as possible, reasonably commented internally, and, besides, there is a help file with more prolific descriptions. You may easily switch 3D objects and their properties, except for color, which comes from the source image. Examples below will be added with short notation of change introduced between 3zaika output and rendering.</p>
        <p>Any 3zaika output scene is already equipped with several predefined objects (below is an intersection of four cylinders coming along tetrahedron axes, with some rough pearl finish):</p>
        <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='3z/302.png' width='512'><p class='small center pre'>thingie_7; thingie_finish_4; rotate_rnd = <60, 60, 60>;</p></div>
        <p>plus you can add external objects to the scene;</p>
        <p><b>Mapping.</b> It means you can map (make dependant of) some 3D object property to some source image pixel property. For example, on sample image below hexagonal prism (one of predefined objects) height is mapped to source brightness:</p>
        <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='3z/301.png' width='512'><p class='small center pre'>thingie_4; map_2(c); scale_map = <0, 0, 2>; move_rnd = <0, 0, 0.1></p></div>
        <p>Object texture, beside color and finish, include normal modifier, which can be modified independently of object itself:</p>
        <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='3z/303.png' width='512'><p class='small center pre'>thingie_normal_4; normal_rotate_rnd = <0, 0, 180>;</p></div>
        <p>And finally, whole bunch of settings may be redefined by inserting external .inc file:</p>
        <div class='justborder center' style='break-inside: avoid;'><img src='3z/304.png' width='512'><p class='small center pre lightbg'>#include "preset_01.inc"</p></div>
        <p>"preset_01.inc" is included in distribution and defines icosahedron. Sorry for a small preview, surely you'll find a use for icosahedron in something bigger. Icosaheda don't grow on trees, after all.</p>

        <p>Do you know that there are priceless collections of jewels you can get for free?</p>
        <p><a href='https://github.com/syanenko/povgems' target='_top'>POV-Ray gems</a> contain several gem examples in POVRay format. While their finishes are too cool for me to understand, I still can borrow jewels geometry files provided there in POVRay .inc format.</p>
        <div class='justborder center chess' style='column-span: all;'><img src='3z/305.png' width='1021'></div>
        <p>Here's an example of importing one of geometry files into casual scene with object size mapped to brightness and some random rotation. Note that I oversimplified the finish due to my lack of patience (most of the beauty of originals come from details of light interaction, taking a lot to render), so consider this image more like showing direction rather than final masterpiece of some sort.</p>
        <p>Apparently, beside gems collection, <a href='https://github.com/syanenko/povgems' target='_top'>POV-Ray gems</a> contain links to other gems-related sources.</p>
