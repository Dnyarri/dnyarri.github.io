    <h3 class="darkbg">Preamble</h3>
    <div class="lightbg justborder cols2">
        <p>After closing <b>AmphiSoft plugins</b> projest long ago in a universe far away The Toad of Great Mental Powers made a decision to implement some of spontaneous ideas, developed or implied, into something potentially easy to understand and hopefully simple to use by humans. As an "easy to understand" mean of production Python was chosen (that was probably an unrecoverable mistake. Or may be not), as ideas regular ones like "what happens if we map image signal to something else" were used. As a result, some Python projects described hereby were created and <a href="https://github.com/Dnyarri/" target="_top">shared on GitHub</a>, free to download and use.

    <h3 class="darkbg">Amble, i.e., the projects:</h3>
    <h4 class="darkbg">POVRay img2mesh</h4>
    <div class="lightbg justborder" style="min-height: 236px;"><img src="imgmesh/320/img2mesh.png" width="232" height="232" class="floatleft">
        <p>Program for converting PNG image into <a href="https://www.povray.org/" target="_top">POVRay</a> 3D mesh, so that bright pixels turns into high peaks on resulting 3D landscape - the more is brightness of source image pixel, the higher is 3D mesh node point. Exported POV file contains everything necessary to be rendered right out of the box (camera, lights, texture), or may be edited later. <a href="img2mesh.html" target="content"><i>Read more...</i></a>

    <h4 class="darkbg">POVRay mosaic</h4>
    <div class="lightbg justborder" style="min-height: 244px;">
        <img src="imgzaika\640\meleft.png" width="324" height="194" class="floatleft"><img src="imgzaika\640\meright.png" width="305" height="194" class="floatright">
        <p>This project currently lists 12&nbsp;programs, converting PNG image into <a href="https://www.povray.org/" target="_top">POVRay</a> mosaic, consisting of various objects - spheres, cylinders, boxes, hexagonal or triangular prisms, blobs or superellipsoids.
        </p>
        <p>Some programs of that group create rather complex scenes, simulating colored canvas or counted cross-stitch.
        </p>
        <p>Rendered images are suitable for scrapbooks, posters, and other creative ways to entertain and/or annoy people.</p>
        <p>All program's POV output is reasonably structured to simplify further editing (changing light, camera, moving and rotating objects, changing object texture).</p>

    <h4 class="darkbg">Scale2x and Scale3x in pure Python</h4>
