            <p><b>ScaleNx</b> is a group of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel-art_scaling_algorithms' target='_blank' title='Pixel-art scaling algorithms overview at Wiki'>Pixel-art scaling algorithms</a>, intended to rescale images without blurring sharp edges, which makes it totally different from regular interpolation like bilinear and bicubic you see in Photoshop or GIMP.</p>
            <p><a href='https://www.scale2x.it/algorithm' target='_blank' title='Scale2x and Scale3x original invention'>Scale2x and Scale3x algorithms</a> (sometimes referred to as AdvMAME2x and AdvMAME3x) were initially developed by <a href='https://www.scale2x.it/' title='Scale2x and Scale3x inventor site'>Andrea Mazzoleni</a> for scaling up small pixel graphics like game sprites and icons without introducing new colors and blurring contrast edges. That's what it was invented for, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>Later on, <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20160527015550/https://libretro.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-1655.html' target='_blank' title='Scale2xSFX and Scale3xSFX original invention'>Scale2xSFX and Scale3xSFX</a> were introduced for the same goal, providing different diagonals rendering and eliminating artifacts initial ScaleNx produce on some patterns.</p>
            <p>Currently very efficient ScaleNx implementations are numerous, but it seems like all of them are developed for screen viewing only, like DOS emulators for old low-color games, etc. It seems that nobody gives a value to rescaling an arbitrary image in arbitrary color mode, and saving the result as a file in some common widespread format. Everybody seem to use ScaleNx only for its initial quite limited task.</p>
            <p>However, it appears that ScaleNx may be successfully misused for something absolutely different, like scaling up low resolution text scans before OCR, or drawings before tracing them to vectors, or simply improving some scans of very old printed materials. ScaleNx capability of keeping things sharp and paying attention on shapes may give very interesting results for a wide variety of images.</p>

            <p>With that in mind I created general purpose (<i>i.e.</i> working with any image of any color mode) pure Python implementation of ScaleNx algorithms. By saying &laquo;pure Python&raquo; I mean it - it doesn't even use bytearrays, only lists of lists of lists. Consider it an exacting spiritual practice or whatever. Anyway, pure Python nature allows current ScaleNx implementation to be run under Windows, Linux, MacOS, or practically anything you can find a Python for.</p>
            <p>You can <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling' class='git' title='ScaleNx module and main program for single and batch PNG, PPM and PGM image rescaling'>download ScaleNx as fully functional application for single and batch images rescaling</a>, as well as <a href='https://pypi.org/project/ScaleNx/' title='ScaleNx module only, distributed via pypi.org' target='_blank'>pure ScaleNx module</a> to include it into your own software, or just to laugh at it.</p>
            <p>ScaleNx package includes suitable human-ready GUI shell, not surprisingly called ScaleNxGUI.py, providing easy launch of single PNG, PPM or PGM (PBM support is limited to reading only, result may be saved to another format like PNG) file rescaling procedure, or batch rescaling of all images (in forementioned formats) in chosen folder and subfolders. Note that batch processing uses asynchronous multiprocessing, greatly reducing run time for a price of devouring next to 100% of CPU power, taking RAM for several images simultaneously, and rendering GUI rather unresponsive, looking like it hung up. Don't worry, it can't hang up, it can only possibly crash when trying to process really huge images (although for most recent version, implementing some memory-saving tricks, I yet have to see it).</p>
            <p>Needless to say, PNG support in ScaleNxGUI is provided with <a href='https://gitlab.com/drj11/pypng' title='Pure Python PNG reading and writing module'>PyPNG</a>, and PPM and PGM support with <a href='https://pypi.org/project/PyPNM/' title='Pure Python PPM and PGM reading, displaying, and writing module'>PyPNM</a>; both are pure Python modules, thus making the whole program quite cross-platform. There is even Python&nbsp;3.4-compatible build (see below), tested and proven to work under Windows&nbsp;XP 32-bit on a twenty years old notebook. Practically, the only problem with Windows&nbsp;XP 32-bit in the year 2025 appeared to be finding a web browser correctly displaying GitHub pages; <a href='https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/' title='Chromium for Windows XP 32-bit'>Supermium</a> appeared to be capable enough.</p>

            <p><span class='red'><b>Update:</b></span> In <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling/releases/tag/25.11.15.1'>version&nbsp;25.11.15.1</a> visual shell program VisualNxGUI.py added to main branch. Program provides a preview for single file rescaling, quick saving with Ctrl+S allows sequential rescaling. Be careful though: during such a sequential rescaling image size grows geometrically, and soon enough will exceed your computer memory. Although later on, in VisualNxGUI ver.&nbsp;26.2.11.7, memory usage for auxiliary processes (<i>i.e.</i>, image display) was reduced to minimum, for a huge images even a minimum is quite substantial. For upscaling really big images, it is strongly recommended to use ScaleNxGUI main shell - it doesn't display anything but buttons and menus, and therefore eat your precious memory for processing only.</p>
            <p>All modules updated to most current version. <a href='https://pypi.org/project/ScaleNx/'>PyPI</a> release for developers updated to ScaleNx 2025.11.15.34</p>
            <p><span class='red'><b>Previously on ScaleNx:</b></span>  - In <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling/releases/tag/25.09.25.09'>main ScaleNx version&nbsp;25.09.25.09</a> and it's Python&nbsp;3.4 companion <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling/releases/tag/25.09.25.34'>version&nbsp;25.09.25.34</a> further GUI legibility improvements are introduced.</p>
            <p>PNG compression and PPM/PGM type (binary or ASCII) settings may be configured via GUI option menus and saved by Ctrl+Clicking on info bar as JSON "scalenx.ini" file in your user directory (directory address get copied to clipboard so you may paste it into your file manager and instantly get right to this directory, wherever it is).</p>
            <p>Preferences file may be edited with any text editor, and loaded back to ScaleNx with Alt+Click to info bar (for toads and lesser species in dementia all these hints appear on mouse over info bar).</p>
            <p>Speaking of dementia, version 25.08.22.34 was intentionally downgraded from <span class='pre'>pathlib</span> to <span class='pre'>os</span>, making it even more compatible with old Python version. Now you can Use&nbsp;the&nbsp;Source&trade; and see how ladies were laid and recursive directory reading was made before <span class='pre'>Path.rglob</span> was introduced.</p>
            <p>Both <i>main</i> and <i>.py34</i> versions are relinked with newest <a href='pypnm.html' title='Pure Python PPM and PGM reading, displaying, and writing module'>PyPNM version&nbsp;2</a>, providing considerable memory usage reduction while working with PPM and PGM files.</p>
            <p>Version 25.02.09.18 of main ScaleNxGUI program have no change in ScaleNx module but is relinked with updated version of <a href='https://dnyarri.github.io/pypnm.html' title='Pure Python PPM and PGM reading, displaying, and writing module'>PyPNM</a> module providing per row file writing, thus reducing memory usage; <a href='https://gitlab.com/drj11/pypng' title='Pure Python PNG reading and writing module'>PyPNG</a> data exchange changed to row generators thus making memory usage as small as possible with this format.</p>
            <p>On my rather old notebook main ScaleNxGUI program appeared to be able to upscale 8224x8224&nbsp;px RGB image with Scale2x and Scale2xSFX up to 16448x16448&nbsp;px, and then successfully save the result as both PNG and PPM. Considering the fact that resulting image will occupy <i>ca.</i>&nbsp;1.4x1.4&nbsp;meters when printed at 300&nbsp;ppi, I assume that further scaling up the experiments with larger images on my notebook may raise doubts in my formally confirmed &laquo;mentally sane&raquo; status.</p>
            <p>In version 25.02.01 FIR optimization of Scale2x, Scale3x, Scale2xSFX and Scale3xSFX performed, speed gain is in range from <i>ca.</i> 15% for Scale2x to <i>ca.</i> 50% for the others (since Scale2x work on minimal kernel already, there's not much room for further list read access reduction, therefore speed increase is minimal).</p>
            <p><span class='red'><b>For Windows users</b></span>, compiled <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling/releases/latest' class='git' title='ScaleNx module and main program for single image and batch image rescaling, latest release, including compiled .exe files'>ScaleNxGUI32.exe for Windows&nbsp;XP 32&nbsp;bit and  ScaleNxGUI64.exe for Windows&nbsp;10 64&nbsp;bit are available for download at newest release page</a>, what as to other platforms, since the program is pure Python and quite self-contained, release source is supposed to work with any current canonic Python installation right out of the box.</p>

            <p>As you can see, Scale3xSFX interpolation is quite unusual and absolutely different from ones you know from Photoshop or GIMP - unlike bilinear and bicubic it keeps image sharp, and unlike nearest neighbour it pays attention to diagonals.</p>

            <p>As a side note, it's worth mentioning that, when working with PNG, ScaleNxGUI.py changes PNG resolution (if present) so that image print size remains unchanged. You may consider using this fact for batch increasing resolution for documents with linked images (or, with some manual intervention, for container documents).</p>
