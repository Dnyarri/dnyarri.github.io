        <h2 class='lightbg'>Scale2x and Scale3x image scaling in Python</h2>
        <div class='lightbg justborder'>
            <p>Scale2x and Scale3x algorithms (sometimes referred to as AdvMAME2x and AdvMAME3x) were initially developed by <a href='https://www.scale2x.it/'>Andrea Mazzoleni</a> for scaling up graphics like game sprites and icons without introducing new colors and blurring contrast edges. That's what it was invented for, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>However, I came up with idea that Scale2x and Scale3x may be successfully misused for absolutely different task: scaling up low-res text scans before OCR, and drawings before tracing them to vectors.</p>
            <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling'><img src='imgscalenx/guismall.png' height='214' width='271' class='floatright'></a>
            <p>Therefore I created pure Python implementation of Scale2x and Scale3x, which can be <a href='https://github.com/Dnyarri/PixelArtScaling' class='git'>downloaded from GitHub</a>. By saying &laquo;pure Python&raquo; I mean it - it doesn't even use bytearrays, only lists of lists of lists. Consider it a spiritual practice or whatever. You can download it as &laquo;ScaleNx&raquo; module to import into other software and/or just to laugh at it.</p>
            <p>ScaleNx package includes suitable human-ready GUI shell, not surprisingly called ScaleNxGUI.py, providing easy launch of single PNG, PPM or PGM (PBM support is limited to reading only, result may be saved to another format like PNG) file rescaling procedure or batch rescaling of all PNG images in chosen folder and subfolders. Note that batch processing uses asynchronous multiprocessing, greatly reducing run time for a price of devouring next to 100% of CPU power, taking RAM for several images simultaneously, and rendering GUI rather unresponsive, looking like it hung up. Don't worry, it can't hang up, it can only crash when trying to process really huge images.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, PNG support in ScaleNxGUI is provided with <a href='https://gitlab.com/drj11/pypng'>PyPNG</a>, and PPM and PGM support with <a href='https://pypi.org/project/PyPNM/'>PyPNG</a> since both are pure Python modules and therefore allow making the whole program quite cross-platform.</p>
            <p><span class='red'><b>Update:</b></span> - In version 25.01.19 Scale2x and Scale3x speed increased, and support for <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20160527015550/https://libretro.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-1655.html'>Scale2xSFX and Scale3xSFX</a> added. The latter methods provide better diagonals rendering and eliminate artifacts initial ScaleNx produce on some patterns.</p>

        <div class='lightbg justborder'>
            <p>Below is the illustration of Scale3x interpolation of small black and white text, twice. As you can see, Scale3x interpolation is quite unusual and absolutely different from nearest neighbour, bilinear and bicubic you know from Photoshop - it tries to keep image sharp and pays attention to diagonals.</p>
