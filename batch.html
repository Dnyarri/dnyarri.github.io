        <p>Repository includes various Python scripts for batch processing. Total number of files varies over time. Most suitable seem to be:</p>
        <p>
        <ul class='dark'>
            <li><b>dir LibreOffice rtf2docx</b> - batch convertion of .rtf, .doc, .odt and .fb2 files to .docx using <a href='https://www.libreoffice.org/'>LibreOffice</a>. Overcomes clumsy LibreOffice ideas like starting several instances, or exporting all files into one dir, or something. Surely may be used for batch conversion of not only rtf to docx (that was it's initial purpose) but also anything LibreOffice can read into anything it can write, like doc to PDF etc.</li>
            <li><b>dir ffmpeg flac2ogg 48</b> - converts all .flac within dir and subdirs to .ogg 48 kHz, using <a href='https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/'>FFMPEG</a>; removes junk like preview and "Zdes byl Vasya" comments.</li>
            <li><b>dir OPTIVORBIS ogg</b> - recompress all .ogg files within dir and subdirs, using <a href='https://github.com/OptiVorbis/OptiVorbis/'>OPTIVORBIS</a>; saves up to 10&nbsp;%  of .ogg size after ffmpeg.</li>
            <li><b>dir COMPACT LZX</b> - suitable GUI to Microsoft compact.exe, allowing to compress dir and subdirs using LZX compression (supported since Windows&nbsp;8); modern bloatware typically get compressed 2.5-2.7&nbsp;:&nbsp;1, sometimes 3&nbsp;:&nbsp;1. Well, actually it's an example of redirecting compact.exe console output via subprocess <i>Popen</i> pipe to Tkinter <i>ScrolledText</i> ;-)</li>
            <li><b>dir AdvZIP docx</b> - recompressing .docx after dir LibreOffice rtf2docx gives up to 7&nbsp;%  space saving.</li>
            <li><b>dir RENAME untranslit</b> - batch renaming of files with names transliterated from Russian to Latin back to cyrillic Russian. Internet is full of programs for transliteration Russian to Latin, but not the opposite, and, since I want the file names back in Russian, I had no choice but write something myself, and it seems to be the only Latin translit to cyrillic Russian renamer in existence. Note that it uses real world phonetic replacements rather than ISO&nbsp;9 - I'm afraid nobody uses ISO&nbsp;9 except federals on service. Well, it still doesn't create characters that are not in Latin but supposed to be in Russian (like soft sigh between some consonants and yotized), so may the source be with you to edit.</li>
            <li><b>dir RENAME unflibusta</b> - batch renaming of files according to patterns, like replacing underscores with spaces, removing digits, and so on. Edit rules pattern to your need.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Note that programs <i>dir COMPACT LZX</i>, <i>dir OPTIVORBIS ogg</i> and <i>dir ffmpeg flac2ogg 48</i> accept command line arguments at start time. Argument is supposed to be a name of folder; in this case program GUI opens right in this folder. If argument happen to be a file, GUI will be opened in folder containing it. You may use it for creating shortcuts like:</p>
        <pre>    pythonw.exe "dir COMPACT LZX.py.py" "%1"</pre>
        <p>(using actual addresses of Python and script on your system, of course) and then simply drag-and-drop folders onto shortcut to open program right where you need it. If argument is absent (e.g., you just double-click program), program simply opens in default directory and wait for you to browse and point to required location.</p>
